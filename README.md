Since all of the options presented have the same types of data, essentially what you're choosing is only the size of the skips and for how long you wish to hire them. Every other point of data seems to be dependant on these options, at least from what can be assumed from just the previous design and the api. My idea was to remove the redundancy of multiple buttons doing the same thing and replace them with dropdown that then have the information in the one card change based on the user's choice. This also has the consequence of not having to scroll the page in order to see all the options, less user interaction necesary. The color scheme can remain unchanged, because it works well with the rest of the website up to that point. I used material UI and react for speed of execution.
